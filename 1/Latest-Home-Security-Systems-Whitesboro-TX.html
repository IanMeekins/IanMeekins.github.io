<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were outstanding in our testing-- during the day and during the night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We must keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the image quality based on readily available bandwidth, which might change throughout the day.

Here is what this indicates, by method of an example. Assume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image across a far bigger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
