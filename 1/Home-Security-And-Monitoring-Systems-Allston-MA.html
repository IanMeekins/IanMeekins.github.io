<p>Untidy and obvious wires encountering walls and floorboards are an eyesore - regardless of the scenario.

If somebody were to unlock that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking enables the electrical present to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will trigger.</p>
