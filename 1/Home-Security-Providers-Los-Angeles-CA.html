<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.

When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs each time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
