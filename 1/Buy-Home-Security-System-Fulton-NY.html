<p>Dependability has long been at the heart of the dispute over hardwired versus wireless home security systems. It's a dispute that's often skewed by elements such as apprehension over the susceptibility of wireless systems, including interference from radio signals and glitches that trigger false alarms.

Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
