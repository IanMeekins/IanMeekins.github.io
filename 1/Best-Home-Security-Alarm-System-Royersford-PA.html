If you go on getaway and have someone coming by to feed family pets or inspect on your home, set a short-lived password and reset it as soon as you return.

<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were impressive in our testing-- throughout the day and during the night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We need to keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the image quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which could change throughout the day.
