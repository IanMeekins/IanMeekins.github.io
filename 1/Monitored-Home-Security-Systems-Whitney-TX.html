Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I tested, consisting of creative things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit.

<p>Some of the home security companies profiled in this report consist of ADT, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, Assa Abloy, Secom, Robert Bosch, United Technologies, Godrej & Boyce, Allegion, Control4, Schneider Electric, Legrand, Comcast, and Vivint.
