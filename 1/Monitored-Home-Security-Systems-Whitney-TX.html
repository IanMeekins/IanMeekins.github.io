<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, dealing with advanced wise home connoisseurs or fans of a particular ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I tested, consisting of creative things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit. However the Secure is costly, extra sensing units are costly, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't consist of emergency alarm or camera backups-- is also expensive if you do not dedicate to a three-year contract.</p>
<p>Some of the home security companies profiled in this report consist of ADT, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, Assa Abloy, Secom, Robert Bosch, United Technologies, Godrej & Boyce, Allegion, Control4, Schneider Electric, Legrand, Comcast, and Vivint.
