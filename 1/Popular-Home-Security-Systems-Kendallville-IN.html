The Ring Floodlight Web cam integrates 2 necessary devices in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera finds motion, it turns on its two powerful LED beams along with its sharp 1080p camera, and starts recording. The Floodlight Cam also has a loud speaker, so you can speak with whoever remains in front of the camera, and hear their actions. Outdoor cameras are among the best ways to prevent (and catch) intruders, vandals, and other evildoers. Like indoor security cameras, they can be incorporated as part of a home security system or used individually to up the security level around your home.</p>

(We believe this is a more valuable function if you're putting the Circle 2 outside, where automobiles regularly pass.) Although having the membership makes this camera smarter, it's terrific that it's not needed, as it is with some cameras, including the Nest Web cam.</p>
