<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are 3 times more likely to be robbed. If you want to watch on what's taking place in your home when you're not there, but you do not want to invest in a full-fledged home security system, a Wi-Fi-connected camera deserves an appearance. These are the best indoor home security cameras in our testing. Aside from fantastic equipment, Frontpoint utilizes 100% wireless equipment using cellular technology.

Cove: Best for the fundamentals-- Cove is a lot like SimpliSafe as far as pricing goes, however its equipment is a little fancier total. But Cove just has one camera option and it's not the best.

Many systems nowadays are Monitored" to an ARC (Alarm Receiving Centre) when an intruder is spotted.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
