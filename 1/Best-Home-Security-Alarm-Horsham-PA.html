<h3>Home Security Monitoring System in Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>Because it's more complicated than it needs to be, we do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, alerts, and integration all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we typically discovered action missing, thanks to irregular and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies whenever you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
