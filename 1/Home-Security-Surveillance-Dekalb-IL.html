This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, however not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for further wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch.

<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the same spot and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had actually installed on the patio by a licensed electrician (who takes place to be my other half).
