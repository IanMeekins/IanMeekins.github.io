<p>Discover how to design, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase worker safety and lower crime. The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, but it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image. In our screening, nevertheless, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with terrible night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot.
