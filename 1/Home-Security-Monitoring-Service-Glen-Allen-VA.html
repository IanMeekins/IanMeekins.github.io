<p>Establishing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or residential property is the responsibility of the whole community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first concern you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The response hinges on a couple of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you mean to keep and how long you plan to keep documented video. The video is going to consume up storage space rapidly if there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video footage as soon as you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not cautious, the system might overwrite archived video that you still need.</p>
