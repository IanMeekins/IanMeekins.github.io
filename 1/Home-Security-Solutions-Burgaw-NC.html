In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
