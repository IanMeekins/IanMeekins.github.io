<p>We do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complex than it must be. Recordings, alerts, and integration all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we frequently discovered action missing out on, thanks to lengthy and irregular spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
