Here is what this means, by way of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
<p>There's a few other cool functions in the camera itself such as an automated zoom which tracks moving items if it detects an intruder; an useful intercom function that permits the gadget to act as a wise doorbell (although it doesn't have a chime or button - for that you'll require the Nest Hey there doorbell ); and, considering that Alphabet owns Nest, the camera brings Google Assistant.

For all the more basic smarts, it's terrific, though.
