<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against fraud, theft, and vandalism. Idea: Often keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we need to once again react to the alarm; each response is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one way of getting rid of costly incorrect alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a particular level, you can make it immediately shut off the heater. If the motion sensors are set off, you can instantly make the wise lights turn on to frighten potential intruders.</p>
