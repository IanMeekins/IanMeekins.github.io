However suicide attackers are plainly not deterred by camera - and might even be attracted to the tv coverage cameras can ensure - and the cost of a substantial video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up around 20 percent of that country's criminal justice spending plan - far surpasses the limited advantages that the system may supply in examining attacks or tried attacks after the truth (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
