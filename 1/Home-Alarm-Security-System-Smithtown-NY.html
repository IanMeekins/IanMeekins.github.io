False alarms are known to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the cops if they take place regularly enough. Another potential downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool need to be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually balanced out by the fact that there are no installation expenses.</p>
<p>Almost all outdoor security cameras are geared up with a motion sensor that will set off the camera to record video when motion is identified.
