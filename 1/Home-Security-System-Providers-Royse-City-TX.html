Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the alarm system will trigger.</p>
