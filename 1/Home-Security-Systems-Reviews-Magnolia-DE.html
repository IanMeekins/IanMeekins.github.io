The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, but it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our screening, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be sensitive, with horrible night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot.

After we used the Anker EufyCam for nearly six months, we're stunned to report that it is on track to deliver on its promise of up to one year of battery life.
