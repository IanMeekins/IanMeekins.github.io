<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment by doing this to make consumers stick with them longer, due to the fact that switching monitoring companies indicates numerous dollars down the drain and a huge headache for consumers. How did they do it? They put 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their most current software application and firmware.

<p>Cross-zoning is a technique that does not require a new keypad. Utilizing several sensing units to monitor activity in one location, software application analyses input from all the sources. For example, if a motion detector trips in one area, the signal is tape-recorded and the central-station monitor alerts the customer. A second alarm signal-- received in an adjacent zone within a short time-- is the confirmation the central-station monitor requires to request a dispatch instantly. This builds in increased protection and a fail safe must a door blow open or a bird rattle an outside window.</p>
