<p>Often a wired system can be puzzled with local alarms. However, the two are drastically various.

<p>Focus on the existing lighting in the areas where you wish to install security cameras. Look for the night vision variety of each camera and consider how much location you want to cover. And beware of using an indoor camera to look outside; they can't typically record images through a window or after dark. When going for a wireless security system installation, all these elements need to be taken into factor to consider.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
