<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a brief description of how thermal cameras work: All items emit infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy given off by an object is known as its heat signature. In basic, the hotter an object is, the more radiation it discharges. A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that is capable of identifying small differences in temperature level. The device collects the infrared radiation from items in the scene and develops an electronic image based upon details about the temperature level distinctions. Since items are seldom precisely the same temperature level as other objects around them, a thermal camera can find them, and they will appear as distinct in a thermal image.</p>
