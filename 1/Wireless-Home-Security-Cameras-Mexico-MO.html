<p>CR's take: The Wyze Webcam V2 is an excellent security camera and an incredible worth. It receives an Outstanding score for video quality and is much easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It likewise does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to keep video locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid membership plans for additional cloud storage.

Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>

If you add monitoring, charges will differ: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 per month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 monthly. If you devote to a three-year agreement, the rate of the Nest service drops to $19 each month. Ring's Protect Plus plan opts for $10 each month and doesn't require an agreement.</p>
