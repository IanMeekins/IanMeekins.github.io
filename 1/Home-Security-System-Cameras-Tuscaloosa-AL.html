<h3>Home Burglar Alarm Systems in Tuscaloosa AL</h3>

As just recently as 10 years ago, consumers did not have access to technology that let them handle their own home security systems. Smart alarm systems changed that. Initially, conventional security systems were hardwired into the home and monitored by a main station, normally a home alarm company. The client paid month-to-month charges.</p>
<p>Video surveillance systems that support with remote security camera viewing is another specialty of ours.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
