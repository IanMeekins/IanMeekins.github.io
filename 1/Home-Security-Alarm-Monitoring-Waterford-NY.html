Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a couple of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you intend to store and for how long you plan to keep recorded video footage. The video is going to eat up storage area quickly if there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution.
