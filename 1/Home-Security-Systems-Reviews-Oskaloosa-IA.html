<p>There have actually long been reputable rules governing the audio recording of people without their consent (there is a reason surveillance cameras never ever have microphones). It makes no sense that we do not have equivalent laws for video recording. Wireless security systems use radio frequency (RF) or sometimes Wi-Fi connections to link security sensing units to the general system. Z-Wave and Zigbee are a few of the more typical wireless technologies used by significant security companies.

Where does the video feed go? Does the camera shop to an SD card, which you'll require to by hand get rid of to move the information?
