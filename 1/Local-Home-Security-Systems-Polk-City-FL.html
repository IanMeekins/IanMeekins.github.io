<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, theft, and fraud. Tip: Often keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must again react to the alarm; each action is billed.

<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
