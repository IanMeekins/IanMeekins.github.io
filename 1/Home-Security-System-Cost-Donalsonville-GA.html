Instead, you can filter occasion notices just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts every time you walk by.

Often, the mere presence of security cameras can frighten less-motivated burglars.

If trespassers can not see any security cameras, they may also be less cautious about covering their faces and their tracks.</p>
