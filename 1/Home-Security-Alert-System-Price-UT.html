<p>Pelco offers video surveillance cameras and video management options for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping hotels, others, and centers.

In Britain, where cameras have been extensively released in public locations, sociologists studying the problem have discovered that they have actually not lowered criminal activity. "As soon as the criminal activity and offence figures were adjusted to take account of the general downward trend in criminal offenses and offences," criminologists found in one research study, "decreases were kept in mind in specific classifications but there was no proof to suggest that the cameras had minimized criminal offense overall in the city centre." A 2005 study for the British Office also discovered that cameras did not cut criminal activity or the worry of criminal activity (as had a 2002 research study, likewise for the British federal government).</p>
