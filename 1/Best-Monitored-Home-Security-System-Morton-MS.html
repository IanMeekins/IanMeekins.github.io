<h3>Home Security System Cameras in Mississippi</h3>
<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the very same resolution specification as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much wider area and therefore uses fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by way of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
