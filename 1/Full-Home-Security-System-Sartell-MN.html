Life can get stressful often, and it can be challenging keeping track of everything around you. Thankfully, a surveillance camera can lend an additional pair of eyes and act as lookout for you and your family.

Central station operators may be advised to call emergency situation services right away, or to initially call the secured premises or home supervisor to try to figure out if the alarm is real. Operators could also begin calling a list of telephone number offered by the consumer to contact somebody to go look at the secured premises. Some zones might trigger a call to the local heating oil company to go check on the system, or a call to the owner with details of which space may be getting flooded. Some alarm systems are connected to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be immediately displayed on a remote monitor, not to discuss tape-recorded.</p>
