<p>Get best-in-class security, plus clever home automation the entire household will love. ADT is a household name, so we regularly try their systems to guarantee they're still up-to-task. In our most current round of testing, we realized that ADT is the most popular provider for a reason. We believe their home protection + home automation + video packages are nipping at the heels of Vivint. That is, they made us feel secure in our home and kept us plenty hectic with cool smart home functions. We specifically liked the ADT Pulse App and controls.</p>
<p>During the night, though it lacks the complete IR LED range of some competitors, the Arlo records enough light to see a good range, and there's an adjustable spotlight offered if you're positioning it outdoors - which neatly brings us to the fantastic motion detection. Not only is the Arlo quick to select moving products, it's brainy enough to make a good stab at working out precisely what it's looking at. Just a couple years ago, the home security market was dominated by a couple of big names providing costly, rigid plans with little versatility and unfriendly, long-term contracts. Systems were limited to a couple wired motion sensors connected to a keypad control panel and go through a landline. Nowadays, this has actually all altered.</p>

(We believe this is a more valuable function if you're placing the Circle 2 outside, where cars frequently pass.) Although having the membership makes this camera smarter, it's fantastic that it's not essential, as it is with some cameras, including the Nest Camera.</p>
