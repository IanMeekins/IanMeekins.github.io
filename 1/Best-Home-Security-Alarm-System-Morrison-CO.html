<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring profound but subtle changes to the character of our public areas. When residents are being seen by the authorities - or conscious they might be viewed at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has actually explained, "understanding that you are being watched by armed government agents tends to put a damper on things. You don't want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he cautions, "individuals may learn to be careful about the periodicals and books they check out in public, preventing titles that may alarm unseen observers. They may likewise put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang members, druggies or hookers." Certainly, the studies of cameras in Britain discovered that people deemed to be "out of time and place" with the environments went through extended surveillance.</p>
<p>Video surveillance is perhaps the next frontier for this innovation - and it's already available for enterprise-level video surveillance systems.

You'll also pay more for pro installation through ADT than you would through Vivint, particularly for cameras. And to be truthful, we're not terribly impressed by ADT's cameras in the very first place. What you're paying for is primarily that big name in blue.</p>
