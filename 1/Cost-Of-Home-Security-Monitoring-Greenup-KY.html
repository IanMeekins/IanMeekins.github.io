<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
