I bought a small (12) camera wireless system for my home and am pretty convenient to install it myself.

<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts every time you stroll by.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
