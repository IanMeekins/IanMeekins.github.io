<p>We looked for DIY systems that offered expert monitoring, both with and without a contract. Although some companies supply complimentary or greatly discounted hardware in exchange for a service commitment that can last anywhere from one to five years, we found no-contract systems to be the most versatile. Some people might wish to register for service only for when they or their partner runs out town, for example. No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and allow you to be in overall control of the equipment you utilize, in addition to how and when you utilize and pay for monitoring services.</p>
