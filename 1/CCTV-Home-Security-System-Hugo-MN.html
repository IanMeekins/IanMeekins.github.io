We should again respond to the alarm; each reaction is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one way of getting rid of costly incorrect alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a certain level, you can make it instantly switch off the heating unit.
