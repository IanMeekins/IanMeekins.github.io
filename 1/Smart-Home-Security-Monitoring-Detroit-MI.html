When a company works with multiple dealerships and providers, its customers are going to get a broad range of experiences. Some will be good, and some will be bad.</p>
<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter occasion notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts every time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
