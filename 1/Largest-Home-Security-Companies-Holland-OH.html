<p>Developing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or home is the responsibility of the whole neighborhood. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first concern you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a couple of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you mean to keep and the length of time you plan to keep taped video footage. The video is going to consume up storage area rapidly if there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video when you reach the system's capability, however if you're not careful, the system may overwrite archived footage that you still require.</p>
<p>Windows And Door Sensors: In many cases, the only way someone can enter into your home is through a door or window. When you have among our security alarms systems in place, if anyone opens a door or window to your home anytime when the system is armed, our central monitoring system will be notified right away so you can take quick action.
