<p>Home security systems and modern smart home capabilities and compatibilities enable you to take advantage of their sensing units and cameras straight from your phone. We thought about only cameras that run over Wi-Fi without the need for a networked video recorder; we narrowed that note down based on reviews, functions, and price.
