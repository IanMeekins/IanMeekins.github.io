<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, since it is rather connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, generally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will be compatible with a given video recorder prior to buying.</p>
