This is not the case as wireless cameras might still require a power cable. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder straight which then links to a router and the internet.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients understand that the low-cost customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
