<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus fraud, theft, and vandalism. Tip: Frequently keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. We should once again react to the alarm; each response is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one way of removing pricey incorrect alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a particular level, you can make it automatically turn off the heating unit.
