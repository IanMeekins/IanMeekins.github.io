<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
