<p>Cross-zoning is a method that does not require a new keypad. Utilizing several sensors to monitor activity in one area, software application analyses input from all the sources. For instance, if a motion detector trips in one location, the signal is taped and the central-station monitor informs the customer. A second alarm signal-- gotten in a nearby zone within a short time-- is the confirmation the central-station monitor requires to ask for a dispatch immediately. This builds in increased protection and a fail safe must a door blow open or a bird rattle an outside window.</p>
