<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
