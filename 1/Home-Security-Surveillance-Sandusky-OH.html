<p>The NVR eliminates these issues, due to the fact that it is rather linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will work with a provided video recorder prior to buying.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
