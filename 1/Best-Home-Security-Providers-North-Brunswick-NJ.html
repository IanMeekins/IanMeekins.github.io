<p>Get best-in-class security, plus clever home automation the entire household will enjoy. ADT is a household name, so we often try out their systems to ensure they're still up-to-task. In our latest round of testing, we recognized that ADT is the most popular provider for a reason. We believe their home protection + home automation + video packages are nipping at the heels of Vivint. That is, they made us feel secure in our home and kept us plenty hectic with awesome smart home features. We particularly liked the ADT Pulse App and controls.</p>
<p>At night, though it does not have the full IR LED array of some competitors, the Arlo records enough light to see a good distance, and there's an adjustable spotlight offered if you're positioning it outdoors - which neatly brings us to the great motion detection. Not only is the Arlo fast to select moving items, it's brainy enough to make a decent stab at working out exactly what it's looking at. Simply a couple years ago, the home security market was controlled by a couple of huge names offering pricey, stiff plans with little flexibility and unfriendly, long-term agreements. Systems were restricted to a couple wired motion sensing units connected to a keypad control panel and go through a landline. Nowadays, this has actually all altered.</p>

If you're going back to square one, we 'd probably recommend a company like Vivint, ADT, or Frontpoint.</p>
<p>View this video to see the Windows software application utilized to from another location see HD security cameras.

Still, we believe that the Arlo Pro 3 is a standout product with its 100% wire-free operation. Its remarkable video quality makes it hard for the competitors to keep up.
