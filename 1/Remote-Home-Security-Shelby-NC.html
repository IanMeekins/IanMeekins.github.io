Incorrect alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the cops if they take place often enough. Another potential disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment need to be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more pricey than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is normally balanced out by the truth that there are no installation expenses.</p>
