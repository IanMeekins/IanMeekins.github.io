It likewise makes your camera more tamper-proof because it does not have wires that can be cut. Regrettably I purchased 4 cameras that look much like these, believing I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the very same camera. Young boy was I wrong!! These cameras hold true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clarity is actually terrific. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
