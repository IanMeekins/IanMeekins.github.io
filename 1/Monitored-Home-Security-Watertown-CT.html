If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must again react to the alarm; each response is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one method of eliminating expensive incorrect alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a certain level, you can make it automatically switch off the heating unit.
