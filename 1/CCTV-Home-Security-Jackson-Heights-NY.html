<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a short explanation of how thermal cameras work: All objects release infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy released by an item is referred to as its heat signature. In general, the hotter an object is, the more radiation it gives off. A thermal camera consists of a heat sensing unit that is capable of finding small distinctions in temperature level. The gadget collects the infrared radiation from things in the scene and develops an electronic image based upon information about the temperature level distinctions. Since things are seldom precisely the very same temperature as other things around them, a thermal camera can identify them, and they will appear as distinct in a thermal image.</p>
