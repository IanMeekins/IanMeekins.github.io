You could invest a similar amount for the very best home security system, however they do not monitor your cameras as proactively as Deep Sentinel.

<p>The very first (and most apparent, for sure) element of a CCTV system are the security cameras. Which security cameras are ideal for your system depends on your specific requirements and budget; are you placing them inside your home or outdoors? Is 1080P a big adequate resolution? Will they have the ability to see and tape video efficiently in low-lighting? Are they placed with sufficient field of vision, or will a PTZ (Pan Tilt Zoom) camera be essential? These are all important concerns to be thought about when selecting security cameras for your CCTV system.</p>
