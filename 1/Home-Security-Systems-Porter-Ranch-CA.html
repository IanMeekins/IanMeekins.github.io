<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it relies on a wireless signal, implying that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and might even activate incorrect alarms. False alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the police if they happen often enough. Another prospective disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool need to be changed or charged frequently in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually balanced out by the truth that there are no installation costs.</p>
<p>The security systems I have actually developed and executed are strictly for monitoring activity of a prospective target, whether from a terrorist threat or area thieves or vandals.

The second surprise was the existence of home security system hacking. Although fairly unusual, as home security systems have incorporated with home automation and the web of things (IoT), they have actually become prospective targets of cyber hackers. When surveying home security companies, as an outcome we made sure to think about the risks of incorrect alarms and hacking as well.</p>

The offers of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance providers bring into question the suitability of the current trend in U.S. policing of allowing 3 or four free incorrect alarms per calendar year, due to the fact that they offer no up-front incentives to encourage owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>
<p>To determine response times for the monitoring company, we activated each system a minimum of five times, using contact and motion sensing units. However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's response time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls need to be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires confirmation from a personal guard. Several cities likewise need a license to even run a home and own security system. Guidelines such as these are created to restrict the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Many towns will fine you for a lot of false alarms.</p>
