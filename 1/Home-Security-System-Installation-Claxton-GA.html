<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. ADT likewise has more industry experience and more monitoring centers than SimpliSafe.

Another possible disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be changed or charged routinely in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is typically offset by the truth that there are no installation expenses.</p>
