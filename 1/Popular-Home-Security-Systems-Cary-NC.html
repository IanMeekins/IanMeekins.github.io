<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
