<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never matches the producer's stats considering that this comes from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest offender for brief battery life by far. We agree with you about Blink's remarkable battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, however its recording capacity is a bit minimal to suggest as a top pick.</p>
<p>Aside from good Wi-Fi, you may likewise require a close-by outlet. Many cameras need an AC connection, which means you won't be able to put them just anywhere. Numerous of the cameras we checked used the option to utilize battery power, but we have yet to find the ideal one. The designs we've evaluated up until now either record very brief clips, leave huge gaps in between those short clips, or need charging on a regular basis.</p>
