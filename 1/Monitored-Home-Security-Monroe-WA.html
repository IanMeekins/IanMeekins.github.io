<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also great metal construction.

Need to be a better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
