<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or totally wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based on our screening, must supply at least a number of months of operation on a charge (depending on use). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses seven days of free cloud storage (with more readily available for a regular monthly charge ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo says will permit the camera to properly spot motion and not get stuck recording on a loop. That also conserves battery life, but it may leave you with taping spaces during important security occasions. If home security is your main issue, we 'd advise among our top picks, but the Arlo is terrific for signing in on family and pets-- or roaming felines slinking around your yard.</p>

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.
