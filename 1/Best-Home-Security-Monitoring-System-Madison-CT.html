Smart alarm changed that. Initially, standard security systems were hardwired into the home and monitored by a central station, generally a home alarm company.

<p>This isn't the most affordable security system from Blue by ADT, but we believe it deserves it for the benefit and security that comes with a camera.

But what about outside the building, or if the burglar has managed to discover their method? This is where motion sensors come into play.</p>
