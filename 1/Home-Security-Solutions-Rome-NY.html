The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also good metal building and construction.

Should be a better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
