<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
