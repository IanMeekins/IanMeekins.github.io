<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
