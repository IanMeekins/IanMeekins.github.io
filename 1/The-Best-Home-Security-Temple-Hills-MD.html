<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of straight plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera. To link more cameras to the DVR system, you require additional cable televisions. DVR systems are difficult to scale up due to the fact that when every BNC connection is occupied by a camera, you need to acquire an entirely new DVR prior to adding another camera to the system. DVRs also need that the linked cameras remain in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality starts to deteriorate.</p>

It's the leading company in home automation technology and it creates most of its own equipment, consisting of the Vivint video doorbell.
