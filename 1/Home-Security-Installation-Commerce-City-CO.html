<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much larger location and for that reason offers fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by method of an example. Presume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image across a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
<p>Each smart device app comes with various settings, so select one that fits your requirements.
