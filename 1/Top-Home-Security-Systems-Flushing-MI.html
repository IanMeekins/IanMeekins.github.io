Beyond those limits, we frequently discovered action missing out on, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally normal given that the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when customers understand that the affordable customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
