<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were excellent in our screening-- during the day and in the evening-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We need to note that the camera would periodically downgrade the photo quality based upon offered bandwidth, which might vary throughout the day. Nest consists of the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>

We've seen 1-year, all the method as much as 5-year contracts!

<p>Unlike many other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies each time you stroll by.
