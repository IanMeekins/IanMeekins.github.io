<p>So, while alarm may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a total security package, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood need to carry a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less robberies across a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent. Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute substantially to police ability to collar burglars makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by police and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund cops response to alarmed homes) a inefficient and pricey approach to theft decrease throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
