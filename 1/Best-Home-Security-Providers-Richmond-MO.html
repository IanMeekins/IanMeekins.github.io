The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses 7 days of complimentary cloud storage (with more readily available for a monthly charge ). Nevertheless, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo states will permit the camera to effectively detect motion and not get stuck taping on a loop. That also saves battery life, however it might leave you with taping spaces during crucial security events.

Lots of current outdoor Wi-Fi cameras provide support for IFTTT (If This Then That), an internet service that uses mini programs (applets) that you create to have the camera communicate with other IFTTT-enabled devices. For example, you can have a wise plug turn on a light inside your home or activate an external siren when the camera detects motion.</p>
