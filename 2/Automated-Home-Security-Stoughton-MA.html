<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, theft, and fraud. Recommendation: Frequently keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we should again respond to the alarm; each response is billed.

If the motion sensing units are triggered, you can immediately make the wise lights turn on to scare away possible intruders.</p>
