<p>Nurse calling systems generally include emergency buttons or pull strings within the client's toilet. If a client is having trouble, he can press the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station. This is a simple switch that is typically open or normally closed. Most of your commercial security cameras consist of dry contact input ports to integrate alarms and alerts, sensors, gain access to control, and so on. My mind conceptualized an approach of not just supplying the client with the patient-monitoring system but integrating it into their old-fashioned nurse call station system.</p>

If you desire home security that mixes into your decor and does not draw attention to itself, then wireless is the better choice.
