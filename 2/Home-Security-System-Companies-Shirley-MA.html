<p>Nothing is more important than protecting what you treasure most ... your household and home.

You can usually tweak the camera's motion sensitivity to avoid incorrect alarms due to animal activity or passing cars if the camera is near a window, and you can create a schedule that turns the sensors on and off during particular hours of the day.</p>
<p>Cross-zoning is a method that does not require a new keypad. Using several sensing units to monitor activity in one location, software analyses input from all the sources. For example, if a motion detector journeys in one area, the signal is recorded and the central-station monitor informs the client. A 2nd alarm signal-- gotten in an adjacent zone within a brief time-- is the confirmation the central-station monitor requires to request a dispatch right away. This integrates in increased protection and a stop working safe need to a door blow open or a bird rattle an outside window.</p>
