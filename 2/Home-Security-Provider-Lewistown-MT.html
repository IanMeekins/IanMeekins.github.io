<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
<p>A system that requires a contract might be a smart choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why?

On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting contract (and who does?). Our pick: No agreement.</p>
