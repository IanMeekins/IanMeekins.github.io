<p>Discover how to create, develop, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and lower criminal offense. The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, however it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be sensitive, with dreadful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot.
