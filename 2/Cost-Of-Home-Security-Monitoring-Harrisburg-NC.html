Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I evaluated, including smart things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit. But the Secure is pricey, additional sensors are costly, and the monitoring service-- which does not include smoke alarm or camera backups-- is likewise expensive if you do not dedicate to a three-year agreement.</p>
