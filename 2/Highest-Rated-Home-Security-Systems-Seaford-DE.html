The response hinges on a number of elements: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video you intend to keep and for how long you prepare to keep documented video. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage space rapidly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest footage once you reach the system's capability, but if you're not cautious, the system might overwrite archived video footage that you still need.</p>
