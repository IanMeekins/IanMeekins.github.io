Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never ever matches the producer's statistics since this originates from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest perpetrator for brief battery life by far.
