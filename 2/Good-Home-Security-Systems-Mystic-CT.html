Outdoor cameras need to be weather resistant and in many cases, totally waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather condition resistance ranking are the most resilient. Bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor alternatives since their style enables minimum glare. In terms of detection, it is much better to have a camera geared up with infrared detection rather than motion detection. This will provide more precise and less regular alerts because oftentimes the motion detection is triggered by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by.</p>
<p>Both of these cameras are equipped with 180 degrees, 1080p lenses with night vision capability, allowing you to have a clear view of a large location.
