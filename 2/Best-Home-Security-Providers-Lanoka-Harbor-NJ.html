<p>Ring may not be the most advanced system on our list (Vivint takes that prize), however it sure has actually gained quite the fanfare over the years. We have actually been evaluating Ring Alarm quite a bit lately, and we really like the system for what it is. So what is it?

Almost all standalone security cameras link to your home's Wi-Fi so you can see what's going on from your phone or tablet, and many have built-in sensors that discover motion and sound and will send push and e-mail notices when those sensors are set off. You can normally tweak the camera's motion sensitivity to avoid incorrect alarms due to pet activity or passing cars and trucks if the camera is near a window, and you can create a schedule that turns the sensing units on and off throughout certain hours of the day.</p>
<p>This absolutely depends on your house. You'll require more sensors and equipment than someone who lives in a studio apartment if you have 15 doors and a million windows. ADT's higher-tier strategies do cost more than the majority of other alarm companies-- plus they need a $99 installation fee-- however if you require a lot of control over the comings and goings of your business, it's probably worth it. And given that ADT provides very same- and next-day installation, you can get that extra security in no time, which seems like good value.</p>
