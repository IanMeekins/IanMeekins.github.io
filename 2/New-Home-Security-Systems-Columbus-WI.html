<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
