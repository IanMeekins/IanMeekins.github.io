<p>One place that offers a fascinating insight into how China has rapidly become a surveillance superpower is Ecuador. The South American nation purchased an entire national video surveillance system from China, including 4,300 cameras. The Nest Secure alarm finishes the circle. Its entry sensors likewise work as motion sensors and feature thoughtful functions like Quiet Open (which lets you open a single door without triggering the whole alarm) and Pathlight (where a night light turns on when you walk by).</p>
<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational criminal activity prevention designed to avoid both individual and property criminal offense and can be used in location of, or in addition to, authorities. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transfer images of a specific location of interest and are either monitored remotely by security workers or preprogramed to scan the defined location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is thought that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will lower criminal activity and boost arrest, without displacing criminal activity to other close-by areas where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
