We love that the system consists of a wifi security camera and only informs you when motion is created by something with the exact same heat pattern as a human (guaranteeing there's no false informs). However, you do need to sign up for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensing units have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have extra sensors and key fobs, too.</p>
