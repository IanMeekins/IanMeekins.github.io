A lot of security companies sell disaster home security gadgets, and clever versions of these devices can inform you on your phone when there's something going on. With those types of stats, it is no surprise home security systems are on people's minds. However in a world where technology appears to develop on a monthly basis, home security systems have ventured into new territory: clever alarms.</p>
<p>One of the best aspects of this alarm is that it has a very innovative motion sensing unit. Because it uses infrared sensors and mass detection to separate between individuals and other inanimate items or smaller sized living things, it only gets activated when a human comes in close proximity. If your motion sensor is set off, you get a notice in your mobile phone app. There's no latency so you get informed instantly so you can take instant actions such as triggering a loud alarm, calling the authorities, or utilizing the camera's two-way audio system to speak to the potential burglars.</p>

Connect with your alarm from anywhere by taking a look at live video, or addressing your front door while you're at work. When you are away, smarter security options keep you in control.</p>
<p>There's a few other cool functions in the camera itself such as an automatic zoom which tracks moving items if it detects an intruder; an useful intercom function that allows the gadget to function as a clever doorbell (although it does not have a chime or button - for that you'll need the Nest Hello doorbell ); and, given that Alphabet owns Nest, the camera carries Google Assistant.
