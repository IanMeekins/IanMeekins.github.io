Hi Rebeca, thanks for this blog site. I am so grateful that you have mentioned about clever home combination Just last week I was provided lot of cameras to install by a property owner, unfortunately the owner did not buy cameras compatible with his home automation systems.

<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were excellent in our screening-- during the day and during the night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video.
