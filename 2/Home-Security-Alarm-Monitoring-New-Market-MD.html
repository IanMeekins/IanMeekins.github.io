(The rest of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.)

<p>In its truest type, a CCTV camera is an analog video camera that transfers signals through coaxial cable to a single central area for video, recording, and monitoring analysis.

The system can be established to communicate by means of network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
