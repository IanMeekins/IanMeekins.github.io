<p>Developing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or residential property is the responsibility of the entire neighborhood. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The answer depends upon a number of elements: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you plan to store and for how long you plan to keep documented footage. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage space quickly.

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs every time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
