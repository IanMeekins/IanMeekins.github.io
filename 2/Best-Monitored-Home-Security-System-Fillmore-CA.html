<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle but profound modifications to the character of our public areas.

You do not wish to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he cautions, "people might learn to be cautious about the books and regulars they read in public, preventing titles that may alarm hidden observers. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang members, hookers or drug addicts."
