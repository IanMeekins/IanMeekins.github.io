<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were impressive in our screening-- during the day and at night-- with a large, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video.

<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
