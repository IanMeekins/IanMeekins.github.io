<p>Motion sensing units use backup protection in case a burglar handles to get into your home. But they just run when you're out of the house. Don't think they'll secure you if someone goes into when you're sleeping! Rather the opposite, your alarm in fact overlooks motion sensor signals if you arm the system but stay home. It would false alarm every time you strolled into a secured space if the system worked any other method.</p>

<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests potential transgressors are less likely to commit criminal activity if they believe they are being watched or have a higher threat of being nabbed. This is likewise known as the logical choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal offense avoidance strategy, which argues that chances to anger can be reduced by modifying a variety of systems such as increasing the threat of a wrongdoer being captured, increasing the effort to commit the criminal activity, reducing benefits from criminal offense commission, and lowering provocations that generate criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This suggests that the culprit needs to be aware of the included surveillance for it to achieve its desired impact.</p>

<p>Unmonitored systems will not offer the exact same level of protection for your home, either. Even if your system links to your smartphone, there are times when you may not remain in a position to do anything about an alarm going off, like when you're on an airplane, in an important conference, or in an area without phone reception.
