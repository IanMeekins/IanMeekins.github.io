Understand that some include cameras in the box, whereas others need them to be purchased independently together with hard disks. Their co. has actually gone way downhill without any fixes in site.

Another possible disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can likewise be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually balanced out by the truth that there are no installation costs.</p>

The second important thing to say is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a remarkably ear-piercing built-in alarm, so it operates as a home alarm as well as a security camera.
