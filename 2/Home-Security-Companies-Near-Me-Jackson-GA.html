As with their indoor equivalents, outdoor cameras link to your Wi-Fi network and permit you to see live video from your phone. They are fairly simple to install, but if you're comfy or not familiar with electrical circuitry, you may want to have a professional electrician do the job.</p>

A local system does not have the capability to couple with other clever gadgets and can not be controlled from another location.
