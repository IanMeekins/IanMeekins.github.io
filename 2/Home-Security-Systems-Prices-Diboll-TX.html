Depending upon the lens' field of view, it can see between 100 and 180 degrees. That's a big variety in regards to the camera's vision cone.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
