As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular given that the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
