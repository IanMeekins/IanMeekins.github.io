Lots of insurance companies offer discount rates on insurance premiums to consumers with operable alarm. These discount rates may be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, numerous authorities departments use several "free" incorrect alarms prior to imposing any fine, even though the cost to respond is significant right from the start. The offers of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurers cast doubt on the appropriateness of the existing pattern in U.S. policing of enabling 3 or four complimentary incorrect alarms per calendar year, because they supply no up-front rewards to motivate owners to prevent false alarms.</p>

<p>Best Professional Installation Security Company - While some security systems use easy Do It Yourself installation, other companies use (and in some cases require) expert installation. Expert installation is available for hardwired and wireless home security systems. Remember that cameras with two-way audio usually work like walkie talkies.
