<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security professionals investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for among our top spots. Nevertheless, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can record up to 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, however entries were typically missing, regardless of appearing in the app's activity timeline. With standard smart home gadgets like automated door locks, you can remain in bed and inspect that you locked your doors.
