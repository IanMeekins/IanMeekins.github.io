For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of an issue but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would cause an interruption in the signal.

<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later on developed to address the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be split.

The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the last IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 standard and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
