<p>Home security systems and modern-day smart home abilities and compatibilities enable you to use their sensing units and cameras straight from your phone. Search for a model that provides a high resolution (1080p), a large angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision range approximately 25 feet, and affordable cloud storage for taped video. In some cases it's valuable to be able to see what happened right before or after a visitor approaches your door.
