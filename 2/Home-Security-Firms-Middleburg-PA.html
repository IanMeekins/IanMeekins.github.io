<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle however extensive modifications to the character of our public spaces.

As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually pointed out, "knowing that you are being enjoyed by armed government representatives tends to put a damper on things. You do not want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "individuals might find out to be careful about the books and periodicals they read in public, avoiding titles that might alarm hidden observers.
