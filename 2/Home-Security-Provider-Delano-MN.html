The one significant benefit of 4K resolution is the ability to fix information after the reality, which suggests that users can focus on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution uses some benefits, it also brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are very large and take up a lot of tape-recording storage area.

These cameras are true 1080p and work perfectly right out of the box. They are well aligned and focused. The clearness is actually terrific. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
