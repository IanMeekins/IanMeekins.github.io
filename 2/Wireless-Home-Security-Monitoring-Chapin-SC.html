<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a harmful enemy, because the interruption of the network avoids the flow of data and in fact indirectly protects information by preventing it from being transferred.

This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools available which can introduce a dictionary design attack of "possibly accepted" security keys based on the "model" security essential caught during the network healing.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal considering that the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients realize that the affordable customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
