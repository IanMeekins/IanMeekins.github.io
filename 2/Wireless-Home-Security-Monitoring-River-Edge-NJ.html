<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle but profound modifications to the character of our public areas.

As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually mentioned, "understanding that you are being viewed by armed government agents tends to deter things. You don't wish to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he alerts, "individuals may learn to be cautious about the books and periodicals they read in public, preventing titles that may alarm hidden observers. They might also put more believed into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, druggies or hookers."
