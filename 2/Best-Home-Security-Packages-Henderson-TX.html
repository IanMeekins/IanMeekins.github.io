<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security professionals looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for one of our top spots. However, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape-record up to 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, however entries were frequently missing, regardless of appearing in the app's activity timeline. With standard smart home gadgets like automatic door locks, you can remain in bed and inspect that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you watch out for potential plan burglars or speak to visitors who stop by.</p>
<p>Some wireless security service providers have additional features and plans for an included cost. If you  want to have continuous video recording and cloud storage for your security cameras, you'll have to pay a month-to-month or yearly  cost. Many of these deals do not include a contract, but some might require an agreement for the equipment or professional monitoring services. For example, Scout just offers one security camera (and it's for indoor use only). If you want a couple of more sets of eyes on your property, however, Scout Alarm integrates with Nest Cams, which can send out motion alerts to your Scout app.</p>
