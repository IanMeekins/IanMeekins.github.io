<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. ADT also has more market experience and more monitoring centers than SimpliSafe. This especially matters throughout emergency situations-- if a natural disaster takes down one ADT monitoring center, the others are still up and running to protect your home. The Nest Knowing Thermostat includes a screen that lights up upon user approach, connects to Wi-Fi, and changes itself based upon tenancy detection. Much like the Nest Thermostat E, it uses information from other smart gadgets to discover your temperature preferences and sends you alerts to notify you of any changes.</p>
