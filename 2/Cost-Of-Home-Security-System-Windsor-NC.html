<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a quick explanation of how thermal cameras work: All things produce infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature.

A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that is capable of finding tiny distinctions in temperature. The gadget gathers the infrared radiation from items in the scene and creates an electronic image based upon information about the temperature distinctions. Since things are rarely exactly the exact same temperature as other items around them, a thermal camera can find them, and they will appear as distinct in a thermal image.</p>
