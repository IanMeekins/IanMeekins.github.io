<p>Get best-in-class security, plus smart home automation the entire household will enjoy. How much bandwidth your camera utilizes depends on lots of factors. A few of the factors to consider include image resolution and whether your camera records whatever or only clips triggered by motion or sound. Home security systems are a one-time financial investment that can pay off, big time, down the line. Does the ideal system have all the bells and whistles, from facial acknowledgment to floodlights?
