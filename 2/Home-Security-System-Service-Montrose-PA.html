However, there are still some wireless home security systems that use a web connection as their primary communication source.

Incorrect alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the cops if they happen regularly enough. Another prospective drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment need to be replaced or charged frequently in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually offset by the reality that there are no installation expenses.</p>

We have actually seen 1-year, all the method up to 5-year agreements!
