As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal because the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
