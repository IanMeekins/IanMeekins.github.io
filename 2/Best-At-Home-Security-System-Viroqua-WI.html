<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
