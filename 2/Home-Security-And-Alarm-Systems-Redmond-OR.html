For the majority of homes, you'll need several Minuts throughout your property, which can get expensive. It's likewise worth keeping in mind that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it just keeps an eye on for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly. It also had the quietest alarm of all that we checked and there's no external monitoring service offered.</p>
