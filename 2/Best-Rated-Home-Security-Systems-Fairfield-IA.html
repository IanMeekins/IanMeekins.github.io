<p>There was as soon as a time when home security indicated splurging on high-end cameras, motion sensing units, and a professional set-up. Not anymore! Gone are those days of professional installation and a complex purchasing procedure. With the introduction of contemporary innovation you now have smarter and affordable home security systems that you can set up all on your own. Safe Home Starter is the basic set with motion, door, and window sensing units. Safe Home Everyday uses extra sensors, while Safe Home Plus includes glass break detection.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
