<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally normal given that the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when clients understand that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
