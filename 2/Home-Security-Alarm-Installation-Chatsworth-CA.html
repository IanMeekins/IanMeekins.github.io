<p>The night vision on this camera is applauded time and again in client reviews, and it delivers a crisp image approximately 32 feet. And even though the app and software are easy to deal with, it's a bit of a disappointment that you can't incorporate this camera with any wise home hubs or gadgets.

<p>You would be hard-pressed to tell the difference in between 1080p and 4K resolution when taking a look at a typical camera image. The one significant benefit of 4K resolution is the ability to resolve information after the truth, which indicates that users can focus on information such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution offers some advantages, it also brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are huge and use up a lot of tape-recording storage area. A lot, in truth, that they need about four times the disk drive space of 1080p to record the same length of video footage. If extended video storage is important, be prepared to invest more money.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
