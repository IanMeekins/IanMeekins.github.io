<p>CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is an excellent security camera and a phenomenal value. It gets an Excellent rating for video quality and is much easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It likewise succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of free storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to store footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid membership plans for extra cloud storage.
