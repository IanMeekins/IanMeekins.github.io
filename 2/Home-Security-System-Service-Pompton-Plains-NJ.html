<p>Another important subject to talk about is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to comprehend just how much is enough. In this article, the term resolution" describes the variety of dots (pixels) that make up a video picture; the more dots, the more detailed the video image.

Surveillance cameras are likewise produced in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no.
