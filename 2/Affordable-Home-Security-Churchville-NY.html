<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much broader location and for that reason offers less pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by method of an example. Assume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image across a far larger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts whenever you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
