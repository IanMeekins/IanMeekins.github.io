<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular considering that the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
