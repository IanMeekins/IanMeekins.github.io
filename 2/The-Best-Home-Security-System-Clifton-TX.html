Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts each time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
