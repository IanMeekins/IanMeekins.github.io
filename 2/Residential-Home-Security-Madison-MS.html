<p>So, while alarm systems may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a general security plan, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the community must take on a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms caused much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less thefts across a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more obvious. However, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute considerably to cops ability to capture burglars makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by cops and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers support police response to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a pricey and inefficient  method to break-in reduction throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, generally referred to as shock sensing units, are various because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
