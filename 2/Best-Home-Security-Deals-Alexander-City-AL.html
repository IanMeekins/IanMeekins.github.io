<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs each time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>

ADT also works with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa so you can control your security system with your voice. 10,000 careful citizens with smart devices is better security than one security individual enjoying 10,000 individuals on CCTV.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
