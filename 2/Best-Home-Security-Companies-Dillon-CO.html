These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and permits that user to see the footage from anywhere. A common misconception is that wireless implies the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still require a power cable. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder directly which then links to the web and a router.

A 2005 study for the British Home Office likewise discovered that cameras did not cut criminal activity or the fear of criminal offense (as had a 2002 research study, also for the British federal government).</p>
